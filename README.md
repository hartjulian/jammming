# Jammming

## Project purpose
This project is part of a learning path on Codecademy.com.  
The purpose of this project is to further develop and demonstrate some of the skills I have learned so far in this course.

## Technologies used
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Features
* Search for songs, albums or artists, and create a custom playlist saved to your own spotify account.

## Future work
* Styling changes.
* Implement pagination/scrolling for search results.
* Playlist management to allow users to edit existing playlists, instead of only creating new playlists.

#### yes the extra m in jammming is intentional :-)
